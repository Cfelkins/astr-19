##Define floating numbers

a = 9.11
b = 6.02

#First, find the sum of floats

s = a + b

#Before printing the answer, let's print the data type of the answer. 

print ('float:')
print (s)

##Define some integers and print the data type and then the difference. 

x = 5
y = 10

print ('integer:')
print (x - y)

##Print data type of the product of an integer and a float and then print the product. 

print ('float:')
print (a * y)
